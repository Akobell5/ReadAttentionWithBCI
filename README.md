# ReadAttentionWithBCI
This MATLAB code allows you to read the attention value of a human being using a Mindwave Mobile Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) device. By connecting the BCI device to your computer via a COM port, you can access real-time attention data captured by the device.
Instructions:

Connect the Mindwave Mobile BCI device to your computer using the provided USB dongle.
Open the MATLAB code file (ReadAttention_MindwaveMobile.m) in MATLAB.
Modify the portnum variable in the code to specify the COM port number to which your BCI device is connected.
Run the MATLAB code to start reading attention data from the BCI device.
The code will display the attention values in the Command Window and plot a real-time graph of attention over time.
Requirements:
MATLAB software installed on your computer.
Mindwave Mobile Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) device.
Thinkgear.dll library (included in the code file).
Note: Ensure that the Mindwave Mobile BCI device is properly paired and connected to your computer before running the MATLAB code.
